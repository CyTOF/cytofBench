# cytofBench
This repository stores source code for our benchmarking comparison on current CyTOF clustering tools, which will be published at Genome Biology:
Xiao Liu, Weichen Song, Brandon Y. Wong, Ting Zhang, Shunying Yu, Guan Ning Lin, and Xianting Ding. A Comparison Framework and Guideline of Clustering Methods for Mass Cytometry Data.  (2019)

Note, the input and output codes for Accense were modified according to our requirement. Other tools were run at default settings unless specified in the manuscript.
